The following features in this project were inspired by patterns from the superpowers
Claude Code plugin, specifically the `subagent-driven-development` and `writing-plans`
skills:

- Self-review checklists in implementation sub-agent prompts (`prompts/implement-*.md`, `prompts/tdd-implement.md`)
- Question-asking encouragement in sub-agent prompts (all `prompts/*.md`)
- Per-task spec compliance checking (`prompts/spec-compliance-check.md`)
- Adversarial verification framing (`prompts/verify-requirement.md`, `prompts/reverify-requirement.md`)
- Conditional commit-per-task workflow step
